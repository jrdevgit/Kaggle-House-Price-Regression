# Kaggle-House-Price-Regression
This is my notebook that achieved top 5% on the Kaggle House Price Regression Competition. The notebook went through rigorous data cleaning, feature engineering, and creating a stacked model from five individual machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Lasso, and Ridge Regression).
Any feedback will be greatly appreciated!
